Detailed Project Description:
Aim to build a tool that can compare prices from different websites and display optimal prices for a given product in one place.
To achieve this goal, we focus on the following:
1. Fetching prices from two or more different websites. (Web Scraping)
2. Storing data in the CSV file.
3. Displaying the lowest price website
4. Visualize prices
5. Send-lowest price website to the user input email
Web Scraping: Web scraping is a process of collecting relevant information from a particular webpage and then exporting that information in a proper format according to our needs
